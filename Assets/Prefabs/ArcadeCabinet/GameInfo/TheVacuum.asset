  contribution: 'This was my second submission to Game a Week, a fortnightly week-long
    game jam held by my university. These are required to be solo projects with the
    focus being on the code; as such, I am not the creator of any of the visual assets
    in-game, but all the code was written by me.


    The theme for this project
    was "The Endless Void". Inspired by my visit to see my family over the weekend,
    I made a Slenderman-like game where you play as my dog, Jackson, hiding away
    from his biggest nightmare... the vacuum cleaner!


    I would say this is one
    of my more successful projects, and I learned a lot from it; I managed to create
    an effective enemy AI controller, as well as an animation blend space that reacts
    to how nearby the player is.'
