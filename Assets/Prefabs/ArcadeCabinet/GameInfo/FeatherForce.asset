  contribution: This is my first submission to Game a Week, a fortnightly week-long
    game jam held by my university. These are required to be solo projects with the
    focus being on the code; as such, I am not the creator of any of the visual assets
    in-game. The theme for this project was "The Avian Games", with the randomly-selected
    modifyer "Monochrome".
