  contribution: 'This was my first submission to Game a Week, a fortnightly week-long
    game jam held by my university. These are required to be solo projects with the
    focus being on the code; as such, I am not the creator of any of the visual assets
    in-game, but all the code was written by me.


    The theme for this project
    was "The Avian Games". I decided to go with a chicken playing shotput with an
    egg since I thought it would be funny :)


    All in all, I love how this turned
    out. I learned a lot about cameras, coroutines, inputs, and animations. If I
    were to make this game again, I would probably calculate the shake speed using
    a different equation as some people on my course pointed out you can actually
    cheat by shaking the mouse in the first frame only, causing a zero-division error.'
