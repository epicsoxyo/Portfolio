  contribution: 'This was my submission to Mini Jam 146, a 72-hour game jam hosted
    on itch.io. It was also my very first submission to a game jam, so I ended up
    massively overplanning for this, finishing a day ahead of time!


    The theme
    for this was "Windows", which I interpreted through simulating a Win95 operating
    system with a Vaporwave twist. I''ve included a small easter egg where if you
    click the Start button, the menu opens up to show the credits for the game!


    For
    this submission, I challenged myself to make all of the assets from scratch,
    which I spent a day prior to the jam doing. I then planned how I was going to
    make the game using a Kanban board on Notion. After completing the game, I was
    voted 6th place out of 59 entries :)


    I would say the thing I learned most
    from this experience was how to plan effectively. I also gained a lot of experience
    in using Unity2D and the UI system.'
