  contribution: 'This is an ongoing project that was initially part of a simulated
    game studio held as one of my modules at university, but which I plan to continue
    for Tranzfuser -- a government-funded scheme that aids graduates in starting
    their own game studio. The game itself is an online multiplayer game in which
    there are two teams, priests and ghosts, each with their own unique abilities.
    The aim of the game is to kill/exorcise all members of the opposing team or,
    alternatively, bless all rooms on the map as a priest.


    For this project,
    we were given the opportunity to pitch a game idea to a "CEO" (our lecturers),
    and -- if successful -- lead a team into making that game idea a reality across
    one semester. I have since been acting as team leader, and have learned many
    soft skills from this: presentational skills, leadership, communication, conflict
    resolution, version control, and scrum development.


    In terms of development,
    I have complete ownership over the player controllers, utilising the Control
    design pattern to easily switch between player types (ghost, priest, spectator)
    and add actions to each. I have also been transferred ownership of the Netcode
    from someone who has left the university, for which I have learned a great deal
    both about working on someone else''s code and about network connectivity in
    games.'
