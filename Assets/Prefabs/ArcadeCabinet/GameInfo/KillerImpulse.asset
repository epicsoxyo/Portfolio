  contribution: 'This was my fourth submission to Game a Week, a fortnightly week-long
    game jam held by my university. These are required to be solo projects with the
    focus being on the code; as such, I am not the creator of any of the visual assets
    in-game, but all the code was written by me.


    The theme for this project
    was "The Nightmare Heart", which I interpreted by making a horror game that connects
    to your real-world heart rate using the HypeRate API.


    I connected to the
    API using the Unreal Engine 4 HypeRate plugin. it wasn''t super well-documented
    or maintained, and I had to make a few tweaks to the code to make it meet my
    needs (and my engine version!) However, I gained a lot of invaluable experience
    in using APIs and overall use of Unreal Engine from it.'
