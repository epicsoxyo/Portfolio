  - You want to know how I built the arcade? Sure!
  - Everything you see here was either modelled or animated by me in Blender 4 and
    Clip Studio Paint respectively :)
  - Although don't look too closely, this was my first attempt at using Blender so
    there's a few things that are a bit... you know...
  - Ahem. Well.
  - Ah, the textures on the other hand. Well, to put it simply... I haven't learned
    how to do that properly yet!
  - I'm currently learning how to though! So far I've learned how to apply UVs, so
    all the screens were done by me :D
  - All the other textures in the arcade are just Yughues' "Free Metal Materials"
    asset pack from the Unity Asset Store. Go check them out!
  - Thanks for listening :)
