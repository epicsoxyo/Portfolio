  - I've joined quite a few game jams here and there... probably my two most notable
    ones are Mini Jam 146, and the jam I hosted for my coursemates!
  - Mini Jam is a 72-hour game jam hosted on itch.io. The theme is announced in advance,
    but there's a modifier that's announced the day of. This gives you time to make
    the assets, but not the game!
  - For the 146th jam, the theme was "Windows" with the modifier "nothing is permanent".
    Since I'm a huge fan of the vaporwave aesthetic, I decided to theme my game based
    around this!
  - The aim of the game is to play a cute and   a e s t h e t i c   garden sim for
    as long as possible on your Win95 OS... or at least until all the viruses brick
    your PC and make you lose all your progress!
  - Then of course you have the jam I hosted myself. Inspired by the Secret Santa
    jam hosted on itch each year, I wanted to make my own with my coursemates!
  - To do this, I set up a Discord server with a secret santa bot. Then, everyone
    had to anonymously write letters to their santas, and make the games requested
    by their giftees.
  - My giftee requested an aim trainer, which I made using Unreal Engine 5. I personalised
    it with their name, and added a small bar area since they love making cocktails
    in their free time :)
  - Thanks for listening!
