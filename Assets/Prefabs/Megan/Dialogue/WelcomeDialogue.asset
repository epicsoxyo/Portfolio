  - Welcome to the Arcade! We have plenty of games for you to take a look at, just
    interact with the arcade cabinets to your right.
  - Each cabinet has a "Start" button to play the game, an "Info" button to read
    a bit about how I made them, and a "GitHub" button if you're interested in looking
    at the code.
  - There's also a screening of my showreel down the other end of the arcade, go
    take a look!
  - I'm actually just a holographic stand-in for Megan, so... if you need anything
    else feel free to send a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
  - I'll leave my business card there for you. Have fun~
