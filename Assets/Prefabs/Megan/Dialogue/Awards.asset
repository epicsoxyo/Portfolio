  - You want to hear about Game a Week, hm? Sure, why not!
  - Game a Week is a fortnightly game jam held by my university. Every fortnight,
    we're given one week to make a game using the theme we're given.
  - It's still ongoing, but so far I've received an award every week for my games
    - which I'm really proud to achieve, considering there are around 80 applicants
    each week!
  - My first award, for "Best Presentation", was awarded for the creative gameplay
    transition sequence in my game FeatherForce, the theme for this being "The Avian
    Games".
  - I used a combination of split-screen, lerped UI movement, particle effects and
    3D animations to achieve a unique transition into gameplay for this game.
  - Next, I received an award for "Best Use of Theme" in "The Endless Void" theme.
    For this, I made a horror game in which you play as my dog, who is terrified
    of vaccuum cleaners!
  - The game plays similarly to Slenderman; you must collect 6 toys and take them
    back to your dog bed. Meanwhile, you are chased by an intelligent vaccuum cleaner.
    Scary!
  - My most recent achievement, the "Alumni Award", is one given to the game voted
    most popular among course alumni. The theme for this was "The Wizard's Factory".
  - While not too dense in gameplay, I utilised my game Chronomagicka to try out
    some of the programming patterns I had learnt in my free time. As a result, the
    game was deemed mechanically impressive by my lecturers :)
