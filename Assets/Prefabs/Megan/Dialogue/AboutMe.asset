  - I didn't always want to be a game developer, you know. I actually did my undergraduate
    in physics at the University of Manchester!
  - I learned a lot from it; during this time, I became good at mathematics, problem
    solving, C++, and Python. It also certainly taught me how to work well in a high-stress
    environment!
  - However, coming to the end of my degree, most of my friends were going into either
    finance or research. Great career options, but they didn't quite feel right for
    me.
  - It was then I made my first game - a flappy bird clone - with my partner. It
    was at this point I remembered how much I used to love making games in level
    editors when I was younger.
  - I then saw a master's degree opportunity pop up for videogames development at
    Manchester Metropolitain University - I knew I had to take it!
  - I've come a long way since then, joining countless game jams and just overall
    learning as much as I can.
  - I absolutely love developing games - I wouldn't be exaggerating to say I've found
    my true calling in life!
  - Thanks for listening! If you want to hear about the awards I've received, I'd
    be happy to chat some more :)
